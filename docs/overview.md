# Overview

Remux is an iOS app for remote tmux sessions.

It keeps the app model close to tmux instead of treating tmux as one
full-screen terminal attachment:

- `Server`: a saved SSH destination
- `Workspace`: a tmux session on a saved server
- `Window`: a tmux window
- `Pane`: a tmux pane rendered by Ghostty

A saved server can have multiple workspaces. A workspace can have windows and
panes. That maps cleanly to tmux, while still leaving room for iOS navigation
and controls.

## Current Scope

The app can save SSH connection details, store terminal settings, and open
tmux control-mode sessions over SSH. Ghostty owns tmux command generation,
control-mode parsing, reconciliation, pane projection, terminal rendering, and
input.

Mosh is planned, but it is not implemented yet.

## Non-Goals

- A Swift-side terminal renderer
- A raw `tmux attach-session` terminal UI as the product surface
- An SSH-backed placeholder for mosh
